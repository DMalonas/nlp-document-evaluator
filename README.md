Project Introduction - What You Will Build We will build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.  You don't have to worry about NLP, because we will make use of an external api called Aylien to interact with their NLP system. This tool will help us classify the information available in the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.  Following are the project prerequisites:  Webserver - Node Web application framework for routing - Express Build tool - Webpack. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands. External script - Service Worker External API - MeaningCloud Sentiment Analysis API
